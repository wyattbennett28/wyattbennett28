## Salutations!
I am Wyatt Bennett, an independent programmer from the United States. I've been programming since I was about eight and probably earlier, and since then, I've achieved *some things*. However, I'm still in high school, and I have my whole life ahead of me to do much greater, hopefully!
I'm currently interested in the field of game development and planning on beginning work on an open source voxel engine/platform. Still working out the kinks though.

Other than that, I primarily like to play video games, airsoft, and learn. I hope to go to university for chemistry and/or medicine! Also, I'm very interested in crossdressing- my parents, on the other hand, have other ideas. (Still nice people though, just a bit misguided.)

Enjoy my work (Or hate it, up to you).

### Thanks :3
